My first Swift project! My family and I got really into Yahtzee during the quarantine and started getting into the statistics of how likely you'd be to roll something, but we could not ever agree on what the actual percentage would be and I don't feel like getting a pen, paper, and a calculator out for every roll. Hence, this app, which they've been bugging me to make for years. However, we're all iPhone people and it took me this long (5 years apparently) to get my hands on a Mac and a couple hours to make this work. Currently have a working general odds page, though might come back and make the UI look decent and work on the prediction page, which would theoretically just tell you what to do (or at least give you some options).
